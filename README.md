# Transaction Monitoring & Risk Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Power BI dashboard designed to monitor transaction activity and identify potential high-risk transactions using rule-based scoring.

The dashboard provides insights into:

* Transaction trends over time
* Total transaction volume and value
* Failed transactions
* Fee analysis
* High-risk transaction identification

---

## Business Problem

Organizations handling financial transactions need to quickly identify:

* High-value transactions
* Failed or suspicious transactions
* Trends and transaction behavior patterns

Manual monitoring is slow and prone to errors.
